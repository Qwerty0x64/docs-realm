.. _react-native-acid-compliance:

Realm is ACID Compliant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _react-native-open-a-transaction:

Run a Transaction
-----------------

.. include:: /client-guides/crud/writes/open-a-transaction.rst

.. example::

   The following code shows how to run a transaction with
   the {+realm+}'s write method. If the code in the callback
   throws an exception, {+client-database+} cancels the transaction.
   Otherwise, {+client-database+} commits the transaction.

.. _react-native-create-an-object:

Create an Object
----------------

.. include:: /client-guides/crud/writes/create-an-object.rst

.. example::

   This code demonstrates how to create an object with {+client-database+}:

.. _react-native-upsert:

Upsert an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /client-guides/crud/writes/upsert.rst

.. example::

   This code demonstrates how to upsert an object with
   {+realm+}. We create a new user named "Drew" and then update
   their name to "Andy" via upsert:

.. _react-native-update:

Update an Object
----------------

.. include:: /client-guides/crud/writes/update.rst

.. example::

.. _react-native-batch-update:

Update a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /client-guides/crud/writes/batch-update.rst

.. example::

   The following code demonstrates how to update a
   collection. Thanks to the :ref:`implicit inverse
   relationship <inverse-relationship>` between the Dog's
   ``owner`` property and the Person's ``dogs`` property,
   {+client-database+} automatically updates Ali's list of dogs.

.. _react-native-delete:

Delete an Object
----------------

.. include:: /client-guides/crud/writes/delete.rst

.. _react-native-cascading-delete:

Cascading Delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /client-guides/crud/writes/cascading-delete.rst

.. example::

   The following code demonstrates how to perform a cascading delete by first
   deleting all of Ali's dogs, then deleting Ali:

   .. tabs-realm-languages::
   
      .. tab::
         :tabid: javascript
   
         .. literalinclude:: /examples/CRUD/CascadingDelete.js

   Dog instances from a {+realm+}:

   .. tabs-realm-languages::
   
      .. tab::
         :tabid: javascript
   
         .. literalinclude:: /examples/CRUD/DeleteAllOfClass.js

Summary
-------

- {+client-database+} handles writes in terms of **transactions**. All writes must occur in a transaction.
- {+client-database+} transactions are ACID compliant.
- To write to {+client-database+}, define the transaction in a callback function that you pass to the {+realm+}'s ``write`` method.
