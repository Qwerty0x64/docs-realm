You can, of course, easily read back the data that you have |ref-stored| in
:term:`{+client-database+}`. The standard data access pattern across {+service+}
SDKs is to find, filter, and sort objects, in that order. To get the best
performance from {+service+} as your app grows and your queries become more
complex, design your app's data access patterns around a solid understanding of
{+client-database+} |ref-read-characteristics|.
